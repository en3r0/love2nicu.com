<p>One of my favorite preemie social media pages is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/preemiehood/">Preemiehood</a>! I love their posts and keep up with them. When I was in the NICU, they inspired me so much and I related to them on a personal level. I shared one of their posts on my personal Facebook yesterday. It was called &#8220;What not to say to preemie parents: [the short list]&#8221; Some of the questions included &#8220;Why is their coloring so off?&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad I was able to carry my baby full term.&#8221; </p>



<p>The post was met with a lot of thumbs ups&#8230;and a few questions! Mostly, it seemed that others with non-preemies WANT to encourage preemie mommas, but don&#8217;t always know what to say. </p>



<p>OR they have a hunch of what NOT to say, but aren&#8217;t sure what TO say. So, here&#8217;s a quick post to help encourage others. </p>



<h2>10 Things To Say To Preemie Parents </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6459-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-79" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6459-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6459-300x225.jpg 300w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6459-768x576.jpg 768w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6459.jpg 1174w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>1. You are a wonderful parent to _________.</h2>



<p>Living in the NICU and giving birth to a preemie is very stressful. There are days when you are so exhausted you can&#8217;t even think straight. Whether you are confident in your parenting abilities or are struggling with mom guilt (yes, it&#8217;s real in the NICU as well), hearing you&#8217;re doing a good job is always appreciated. Telling a parent that they are a wonderful parent to their child will bring a smile to their face. If possible, use the child&#8217;s name. </p>



<h2>2. I haven&#8217;t been through a NICU stay, but it seems very challenging. </h2>



<p>Acknowledging a struggle can be so comforting! If you haven&#8217;t personally been through a NICU stay, try to not compare your situation, but, DO affirm the preemie parent by acknowledging that they are in a challenging situation. Also, you can say, &#8220;This SUCKS.&#8221; </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5192.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-80" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5192.jpg 660w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5192-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></figure>



<h2>3. I admire your strength/courage/positivity. </h2>



<p>Sometimes just hearing that you&#8217;re impacting others helps give you perspective while going through a NICU stay. Obviously while in the NICU I was dedicated to my daughter. I did everything for HER. But, in the process you can inspire others. Hearing that others admired certain attributes I displayed was such a special thing. I remember a friend told me she admired my strength and it made my day. Even when I wasn&#8217;t feeling &#8220;strong,&#8221; I knew I was showing enough strength for others to see! </p>



<h2>4. Do you mind sharing a little bit about (their child&#8217;s) conditions/struggles? I&#8217;d love to know more. </h2>



<p>NICU stays are complicated. It really is another universe. There&#8217;s NICU &#8220;lingo&#8221; and a bazillion health threats that are lurking around every corner. Most preemies will be on breathing support, are hooked up to monitors, have feeding tubes, and need medications. The babies in an isolette may look very different than the babies you&#8217;re used to seeing. That&#8217;s OK. A lot of parents don&#8217;t understand everything right away, but learn the terms and &#8220;ropes&#8221; after a few days or weeks. If you see something in a photo, or in person, and don&#8217;t understand it, ask! Always approach the subject with love and a genuine interest. I really enjoyed educating others about Isabella&#8217;s health. By explaining things, such as her NG tube, her need for caffeine, or even her A &amp; B spells, I helped myself to understand it better. I also appreciated others who were interested in her progress and health. </p>

<h2>5. You look great! </h2>



<p>There was a friend that happened to work at the visitors desk at our NICU. It was a crazy gift from God. The fact that I saw her almost everyday, and had gone to high school and college with her, couldn&#8217;t have been a coincidence. Anyway, she always complimented my makeup or outfits. This meant a lot to me. I didn&#8217;t always feel pulled together but used my free time to get makeup on and get dressed for the day. I didn&#8217;t always look done up, but when I made an effort, she noticed. It was a small thing, but it meant a lot. Obviously, only say &#8220;you look great,&#8221; if the parent really does look good! </p>



<h2>6. I&#8217;m thinking/praying of/for you and your family. <br></h2>



<p>Knowing someone is thinking and praying for you is very comforting. I remember after our first few days in the NICU a friend left a voice message of her praying for us. It was so powerful. I listened to it a few times and played it for Bella. Now, not everyone is comfortable enough to leave a recording of a prayer, haha, but just saying you&#8217;re thinking of someone can go a long way. Also, I had a friend that would just shoot me emojis. It was so simple, yet so impactful. I&#8217;d get a kissy face or a heart at just the right time during those long months from her. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6630-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-82" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6630-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6630-300x225.jpg 300w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6630-768x576.jpg 768w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6630.jpg 1174w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>7. I&#8217;m sorry you&#8217;re going through this. </h2>



<p>There&#8217;s a lot of crappy stuff happening to preemie parents. They can&#8217;t take their baby home. They can&#8217;t hold them anytime they want. They can&#8217;t sleep in their own bed. There are a lot of hard things. Inconveniences just scratch the surface. Add the nonstop worry about their child surviving and then the financial strain and it&#8217;s one of the hardest things anyone has ever had to go through. One of the toughest things for me was seeing my baby struggle with breathing, eating, and getting her blood drawn. Most parents can&#8217;t say they&#8217;ve seen their baby struggle to breathe. So, it&#8217;s perfectly acceptable to say you&#8217;re sorry the family is going through what they&#8217;re going through. </p>



<h2>8. Can I help in any way?</h2>



<p>Only ask if you are prepared to help. If so, ask and offer to help. I was pretty open about our needs. We really appreciated meals. We really loved cards. A group from our church sent so many beautiful books that we read to Bella. If you aren&#8217;t sure, and really want to help, send cash, or a gift card. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5796-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-83" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5796-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5796-300x225.jpg 300w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5796-768x576.jpg 768w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5796.jpg 1174w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>9. I love the way you ________________. (dress their child, decorate their room, post updates, make funny posts, etc.)</h2>



<p>A preemie parent has to get used to giving up control. In most cases they can&#8217;t even dress their child for quite some time since a lot of NICUs have a no clothing policy. (This is probably so that they can get to a baby quicker and keep an eye on their breathing/temperature regulation).  A nurse is doing the majority of the child&#8217;s care for the first few weeks and there just aren&#8217;t a ton of things to do for a parent but watch, pray, talk, read, pump (if they have milk) and wait. If a parent is like me, they work hard at decorating their NICU room, posting updates, and being creative. I spent a lot of time making signs for Isabella&#8217;s door and thinking of fun quotes to post on her letter board. When others acknowledged my hard work, it made me feel good. Later on, when Bella was able to wear clothes, others always complimented them. That made me feel good too. It was a nice way to compliment me on a &#8220;normal&#8221; aspect of motherhood.</p>

<h2>10. Can I give you a hug?</h2>



<p>Yep. A hug. Why ask? Well, unless you&#8217;re really close to the parent, they may not like hugs, or want to be touching people because of germs. A quick, simple, hug says you care. (PS- don&#8217;t offer a hug if you&#8217;ve been sick or around someone sick!) </p>



<p>There you have it. 10 simple things TO say to a preemie parent. I hope this gives you a good starting point. Luckily we had some amazing support while in the NICU. There were some super insensitive comments, but many more good ones than bad. </p>
