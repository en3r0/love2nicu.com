<p>Many Preemies, and especially Micropreemies, will be qualified to receive Synagis injections. If you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;re a little anxious about what this entails and what the process will be like. In all of my mommy research, I couldn&#8217;t find great resources from a parent&#8217;s perspective about what a Synagis injection is like. So, like this blog, I decided to try to fill a gap! Here&#8217;s some good-to-know information about Synagis from a momma who&#8217;s been there! </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Healthy-Post-Holiday-Recipes.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-111"/><figcaption>Pin me on Pinterest!</figcaption></figure>



<p>Any type of medication is scary to a new parent. Throw in a 100+ day NICU stay and release papers with an order for injections and your anxiety can get the best of you. Luckily we had a great nurse who educated us about Synagis and why we needed to take the paperwork to our pediatrician once we got home. Now, we&#8217;ve successfully completed a season of Synagis injections and I thought some of this information might be helpful for other nervous mommies and daddies. </p>



<h2>What Is Synagis &amp; Why Might My Doctor Recommend It?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_3954.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-103"/><figcaption>Synagis comes in the mail on ice</figcaption></figure>



<p>So, what is Synagis? <br>Synagis is a medication that helps babies at risk for RSV. The medication is injected once a month by a home health nurse (or other medical professional). As I understand it, the injection has antibodies that help to prevent RSV in babies that are considered high risk, or medically fragile. The injections are NOT a vaccine and your child may still get RSV, however, Synagis can help decrease the chances of your child needing hospitalized. The antibodies aren&#8217;t effective indefinitely, so your child needs injections once a month. The injections are used during RSV season, which is typically from November through March. </p>



<p>Your doctor/NICU/specialist may recommend Synagis injections if your child </p>



<ul><li>was born early at 28 weeks gestation or less (depending on their age)</li><li>still needs treatment for BPD (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) or has some other types of lung problems</li><li>has certain types of congenital heart problems</li><li>has certain neuromuscular or airway problems</li></ul>



<p>Via <a href="https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/family-resources-education/health-wellness-and-safety-resources/helping-hands/palivizumab-synagis">Nationwide Children&#8217;s</a></p>



<p>For us, our daughter was born at 27 weeks and was 1lb 7ounces due to restricted growth in utero. We qualified based on this fact. </p>

<h2>Ok&#8230;but what is RSV? </h2>



<p>Chances are, you&#8217;ve never heard of RSV. We hadn&#8217;t before having a micropreemie. To be honest, I&#8217;m still surprised it&#8217;s not talked about a lot, since it&#8217;s the #1 cause of hospitalization for babies under 12 months. Here&#8217;s a quick explanation from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/index.html">Center of Disease Control and Prevention</a>: </p>



<p>&#8220;Respiratory syncytial (sin-SISH-uhl) virus, or RSV, is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. Most people recover in a week or two, but RSV can be serious, especially for infants and older adults. In fact, RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia (infection of the lungs) in children younger than 1 year of age in the United States.&#8221;</p>

<h2>How Do I Go About Getting Synagis?</h2>



<p>Sounds good, right? A shot that can help prevent hospitalization and help keep your baby healthy&#8230;who knew? Most parents go about getting Synagis through their pediatrician. For us, we were told about it and given paperwork while in the NICU. Even though our daughter wouldn&#8217;t need the injections for many months, we were briefed about the benefits and encouraged to begin the approval process for this drug. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_3952.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-105"/><figcaption>Medication on ice mailed to our home. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Our pediatricians office is under the same umbrella as our NICU/Children&#8217;s Hospital, so the nurses and doctors knew the drill. They took the paperwork from me on our first visit (one day after homecoming from the NICU) and began getting everything in place for the Synagis season. To be honest, I thought this was excessive since it was May and the shots wouldn&#8217;t begin until November, but I was wrong. Synagis injections alone are $3,000-6,000 and that doesn&#8217;t include the cost of the home health nurse or other supplies. The medication is kinda a big deal. </p>



<p>To get Synagis for your child, you more than likely need to qualify. Insurances don&#8217;t like covering this extremely expensive medication. Although ours was pretty happy to since it meant we could possibly avoid a hospital stay, which would&#8217;ve been more expensive. If each injection is $3k, then you&#8217;re looking at $15k minimum for treatment. A child that weighs more needs more of the medication, so it can be up to $6k a dose. That&#8217;s $30k!!!</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re interested and it hasn&#8217;t been brought up to you, ask your pediatrician or specialists. </p>



<h2>Who Will Administer Synagis?</h2>



<p>A home health nurse. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_4033.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-98"/><figcaption>Linda preps Bella&#8217;s injection</figcaption></figure>



<p>Taking your medically fragile child into a germy doctors office kind of defeats the purpose of getting injected with antibodies, right? In most cases, your child will receive their injections at home. This helps to keep them isolated from germs and also away from other kids. </p>



<p>Our pediatricians office selected a home health company on our behalf and helped to coordinate the injections. We went with a company that our insurance covered (<a href="https://www.ohioanshhc.com/">The Ohioans</a>) and our pediatricians office had used before. The injections were pretty new to our area and the home health nurse was actually accompanied by her supervisor for Bella&#8217;s first injection/home visit. </p>



<p>There are so many moving parts, including coordinating the delivery of the medication/supplies that needs to be on ice and coordinating the nurse&#8217;s availability to give the injection. You also have to work closely with your insurance to make sure the medication is covered and you may have to give information about your child prior to them sending the drug. For us, we also had a $40 copay. All that being said, it&#8217;s involved and takes a lot of dedication and understanding from all parties involved. </p>



<p>I worked with: our insurance company, our insurance speciality pharmacy, our home health nurse, our case-working nurse form our doctor&#8217;s office, and then medicaid to get the $40 co-pay covered</p>



<h2>What Will the Home Health Nurse Visit Be Like?</h2>



<p>I&#8217;m sure every home health nurse has their own style and experiences may differ. For us, our visits went smoothly and were enjoyable since we loved our nurse. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_4030.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-102"/><figcaption>You will keep the medication in the fridge. (We have it in a lock box for foster care) </figcaption></figure>



<h3>The Welcome </h3>



<p>To begin, you&#8217;ll meet your home health nurse! Our nurse was a lovely lady named Linda (name changed for privacy). She was super friendly and excellent with Bella. The first visit included some paperwork, which was done mostly on an iPad. The supervisor also came to oversee the injection and interactions since it was new for their agency. </p>



<p>We had already been sent our medication, so I had everything prepared and ready. We had our kitchen table available for paperwork and discussion. The ladies were both professional and sweet. They enjoyed meeting Bella and we had fun sharing her story. At this point, you may discuss what times work best for you for your nurse to come and ask any questions. </p>



<p>The nurse will go through the medication and supplies and make sure everything is included. I made a point not to mess with too much and kept almost everything in its packaging. Included was also epinephrine in case your child were to have a bad reaction to the medication. </p>



<h3>Weigh-In/Vitals </h3>



<p>For Synagis, the nurse will need to check your babies weight and vitals. The dosage is based on weight so this part is very important. The nurse brings a little scale and you will weigh your baby with a dry diaper. The nurse may listen to your babies lungs, check their temperature, and check their heart rate/pulse. </p>



<p>I can&#8217;t remember what Linda did at every appointment before the shot, but I do know she always asked how she was doing and noted anything that was different. She also made sure everything was accurate, including her weight, before drawing up the medication into the syringe. </p>



<h3>The Injection</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_4032.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-101"/><figcaption>All the items set out for our nurse</figcaption></figure>



<p>Our baby was pretty small when she began receiving injections. She was 7 months old (4 months adjusted) at her first shot and 12 months at her last one. For us, we made sure to work around her feeding schedule so that she&#8217;d be able to eat and nap right after her shot. This ended up working out to 12 noon. </p>



<p>The welcome/prep would take about ten minutes and then we&#8217;d get everything ready to feed Bella and cuddle her for a nap. The nurse would hold her and give her the shot then hand her to us. We would walk around the living room with her until she settled down. </p>



<p>The shot hurts. I won&#8217;t lie. It&#8217;s a thick medication that has to be pushed in the muscle. I&#8217;m sure it burns. Our daughter cried and obviously hated it, but she was easily soothed. She only cried 2 minutes max. We always distracted her and began feeding her right away. She liked us singing to her, showing her toys, or rubbing her back before the shot was given and after. Of course Linda played a huge role in administering the shot properly. She moved quickly and handled Bella very well. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_4034.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-99"/><figcaption>Bella getting listened to by Linda on our couch</figcaption></figure>



<p>It was best for the nurse to hold Bella against her chest and stick the needle in her leg. The hold was tight, kind of like a hug, and kept Bella from jerking. I held her arms down as well while my husband tried to distract her. Afterwards, we kept the epinephrine close in case of a bad reaction, but never needed it. The risk was extremely rare. Our nurse explained it and helped us feel much better about giving the injections. I can&#8217;t remember the %. </p>



<h3>Monitoring</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_4035.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-100"/><figcaption>Fast asleep (and eating via gtube) after her injection</figcaption></figure>



<p>After the shot, your nurse will dispose of the needle in a sharps container and stick around to monitor your infant. She/he will check their heart rate/pulse and/or listen to them. We enjoyed this time visiting with Linda. She had a lot in common with us and was even going on a medical missions trip. It was always a welcome visit since we were isolating Bella and I was happy to have adult conversation. Bella usually slept at this point. The nurse would check her leg as well to make sure she wasn&#8217;t having any type of reaction where the injection took place. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_4076.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-107"/><figcaption>A small dot where the injection was! </figcaption></figure>



<p>The nurse will pack up and head out! </p>



<p>While writing this, I realized that some tips may be helpful for other parents. I plan on writing those soon so stay tuned! </p>



<p>Even though Synagis is scary. It&#8217;s been a lifesaver for us. Our daughter hasn&#8217;t been sick but once (a small cold that didn&#8217;t need treated) in a year! Along with the Synagis, we practice good hand washing and isolation. We limit visitors to the extreme and made a commitment to keeping Bella as healthy as possible. I believe that these choices have contributed to her staying out of the hospital and thriving at home.</p>
