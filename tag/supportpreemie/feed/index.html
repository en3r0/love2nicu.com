<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_4052.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-96" width="490" height="652"/><figcaption>$3K for this tiny vial</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Many Preemies, and especially Micropreemies, will be qualified to receive Synagis injections. If you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;re a little anxious about what this entails and what the process will be like. In all of my mommy research, I couldn&#8217;t find great resources from a parent&#8217;s perspective about what a Synagis injection is like. So, like this blog, I decided to try to fill a gap! Here&#8217;s some good-to-know information about Synagis from a momma who&#8217;s been there! </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Healthy-Post-Holiday-Recipes.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-111"/><figcaption>Pin me on Pinterest!</figcaption></figure>



<p>Any type of medication is scary to a new parent. Throw in a 100+ day NICU stay and release papers with an order for injections and your anxiety can get the best of you. Luckily we had a great nurse who educated us about Synagis and why we needed to take the paperwork to our pediatrician once we got home. Now, we&#8217;ve successfully completed a season of Synagis injections and I thought some of this information might be helpful for other nervous mommies and daddies. </p>



<h2>What Is Synagis &amp; Why Might My Doctor Recommend It?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_3954.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-103"/><figcaption>Synagis comes in the mail on ice</figcaption></figure>



<p>So, what is Synagis? <br>Synagis is a medication that helps babies at risk for RSV. The medication is injected once a month by a home health nurse (or other medical professional). As I understand it, the injection has antibodies that help to prevent RSV in babies that are considered high risk, or medically fragile. The injections are NOT a vaccine and your child may still get RSV, however, Synagis can help decrease the chances of your child needing hospitalized. The antibodies aren&#8217;t effective indefinitely, so your child needs injections once a month. The injections are used during RSV season, which is typically from November through March. </p>



<p>Your doctor/NICU/specialist may recommend Synagis injections if your child </p>



<ul><li>was born early at 28 weeks gestation or less (depending on their age)</li><li>still needs treatment for BPD (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) or has some other types of lung problems</li><li>has certain types of congenital heart problems</li><li>has certain neuromuscular or airway problems</li></ul>



<p>Via <a href="https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/family-resources-education/health-wellness-and-safety-resources/helping-hands/palivizumab-synagis">Nationwide Children&#8217;s</a></p>



<p>For us, our daughter was born at 27 weeks and was 1lb 7ounces due to restricted growth in utero. We qualified based on this fact. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_3951.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-104"/><figcaption>Retrieving the Synagis off our porch! </figcaption></figure>



<h2>Ok&#8230;but what is RSV? </h2>



<p>Chances are, you&#8217;ve never heard of RSV. We hadn&#8217;t before having a micropreemie. To be honest, I&#8217;m still surprised it&#8217;s not talked about a lot, since it&#8217;s the #1 cause of hospitalization for babies under 12 months. Here&#8217;s a quick explanation from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/index.html">Center of Disease Control and Prevention</a>: </p>



<p>&#8220;Respiratory syncytial (sin-SISH-uhl) virus, or RSV, is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. Most people recover in a week or two, but RSV can be serious, especially for infants and older adults. In fact, RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia (infection of the lungs) in children younger than 1 year of age in the United States.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_4919.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-97"/><figcaption>Bella &amp; I at one of her appointments</figcaption></figure>



<h2>How Do I Go About Getting Synagis?</h2>



<p>Sounds good, right? A shot that can help prevent hospitalization and help keep your baby healthy&#8230;who knew? Most parents go about getting Synagis through their pediatrician. For us, we were told about it and given paperwork while in the NICU. Even though our daughter wouldn&#8217;t need the injections for many months, we were briefed about the benefits and encouraged to begin the approval process for this drug. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_3952.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-105"/><figcaption>Medication on ice mailed to our home. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Our pediatricians office is under the same umbrella as our NICU/Children&#8217;s Hospital, so the nurses and doctors knew the drill. They took the paperwork from me on our first visit (one day after homecoming from the NICU) and began getting everything in place for the Synagis season. To be honest, I thought this was excessive since it was May and the shots wouldn&#8217;t begin until November, but I was wrong. Synagis injections alone are $3,000-6,000 and that doesn&#8217;t include the cost of the home health nurse or other supplies. The medication is kinda a big deal. </p>



<p>To get Synagis for your child, you more than likely need to qualify. Insurances don&#8217;t like covering this extremely expensive medication. Although ours was pretty happy to since it meant we could possibly avoid a hospital stay, which would&#8217;ve been more expensive. If each injection is $3k, then you&#8217;re looking at $15k minimum for treatment. A child that weighs more needs more of the medication, so it can be up to $6k a dose. That&#8217;s $30k!!!</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re interested and it hasn&#8217;t been brought up to you, ask your pediatrician or specialists. </p>



<h2>Who Will Administer Synagis?</h2>



<p>A home health nurse. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_4033.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-98"/><figcaption>Linda preps Bella&#8217;s injection</figcaption></figure>



<p>Taking your medically fragile child into a germy doctors office kind of defeats the purpose of getting injected with antibodies, right? In most cases, your child will receive their injections at home. This helps to keep them isolated from germs and also away from other kids. </p>



<p>Our pediatricians office selected a home health company on our behalf and helped to coordinate the injections. We went with a company that our insurance covered (<a href="https://www.ohioanshhc.com/">The Ohioans</a>) and our pediatricians office had used before. The injections were pretty new to our area and the home health nurse was actually accompanied by her supervisor for Bella&#8217;s first injection/home visit. </p>



<p>There are so many moving parts, including coordinating the delivery of the medication/supplies that needs to be on ice and coordinating the nurse&#8217;s availability to give the injection. You also have to work closely with your insurance to make sure the medication is covered and you may have to give information about your child prior to them sending the drug. For us, we also had a $40 copay. All that being said, it&#8217;s involved and takes a lot of dedication and understanding from all parties involved. </p>



<p>I worked with: our insurance company, our insurance speciality pharmacy, our home health nurse, our case-working nurse form our doctor&#8217;s office, and then medicaid to get the $40 co-pay covered</p>



<h2>What Will the Home Health Nurse Visit Be Like?</h2>



<p>I&#8217;m sure every home health nurse has their own style and experiences may differ. For us, our visits went smoothly and were enjoyable since we loved our nurse. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_4030.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-102"/><figcaption>You will keep the medication in the fridge. (We have it in a lock box for foster care) </figcaption></figure>



<h3>The Welcome </h3>



<p>To begin, you&#8217;ll meet your home health nurse! Our nurse was a lovely lady named Linda (name changed for privacy). She was super friendly and excellent with Bella. The first visit included some paperwork, which was done mostly on an iPad. The supervisor also came to oversee the injection and interactions since it was new for their agency. </p>



<p>We had already been sent our medication, so I had everything prepared and ready. We had our kitchen table available for paperwork and discussion. The ladies were both professional and sweet. They enjoyed meeting Bella and we had fun sharing her story. At this point, you may discuss what times work best for you for your nurse to come and ask any questions. </p>



<p>The nurse will go through the medication and supplies and make sure everything is included. I made a point not to mess with too much and kept almost everything in its packaging. Included was also epinephrine in case your child were to have a bad reaction to the medication. </p>



<h3>Weigh-In/Vitals </h3>



<p>For Synagis, the nurse will need to check your babies weight and vitals. The dosage is based on weight so this part is very important. The nurse brings a little scale and you will weigh your baby with a dry diaper. The nurse may listen to your babies lungs, check their temperature, and check their heart rate/pulse. </p>



<p>I can&#8217;t remember what Linda did at every appointment before the shot, but I do know she always asked how she was doing and noted anything that was different. She also made sure everything was accurate, including her weight, before drawing up the medication into the syringe. </p>



<h3>The Injection</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_4032.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-101"/><figcaption>All the items set out for our nurse</figcaption></figure>



<p>Our baby was pretty small when she began receiving injections. She was 7 months old (4 months adjusted) at her first shot and 12 months at her last one. For us, we made sure to work around her feeding schedule so that she&#8217;d be able to eat and nap right after her shot. This ended up working out to 12 noon. </p>



<p>The welcome/prep would take about ten minutes and then we&#8217;d get everything ready to feed Bella and cuddle her for a nap. The nurse would hold her and give her the shot then hand her to us. We would walk around the living room with her until she settled down. </p>



<p>The shot hurts. I won&#8217;t lie. It&#8217;s a thick medication that has to be pushed in the muscle. I&#8217;m sure it burns. Our daughter cried and obviously hated it, but she was easily soothed. She only cried 2 minutes max. We always distracted her and began feeding her right away. She liked us singing to her, showing her toys, or rubbing her back before the shot was given and after. Of course Linda played a huge role in administering the shot properly. She moved quickly and handled Bella very well. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_4034.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-99"/><figcaption>Bella getting listened to by Linda on our couch</figcaption></figure>



<p>It was best for the nurse to hold Bella against her chest and stick the needle in her leg. The hold was tight, kind of like a hug, and kept Bella from jerking. I held her arms down as well while my husband tried to distract her. Afterwards, we kept the epinephrine close in case of a bad reaction, but never needed it. The risk was extremely rare. Our nurse explained it and helped us feel much better about giving the injections. I can&#8217;t remember the %. </p>



<h3>Monitoring</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_4035.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-100"/><figcaption>Fast asleep (and eating via gtube) after her injection</figcaption></figure>



<p>After the shot, your nurse will dispose of the needle in a sharps container and stick around to monitor your infant. She/he will check their heart rate/pulse and/or listen to them. We enjoyed this time visiting with Linda. She had a lot in common with us and was even going on a medical missions trip. It was always a welcome visit since we were isolating Bella and I was happy to have adult conversation. Bella usually slept at this point. The nurse would check her leg as well to make sure she wasn&#8217;t having any type of reaction where the injection took place. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_4076.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-107"/><figcaption>A small dot where the injection was! </figcaption></figure>



<p>The nurse will pack up and head out! </p>



<p>While writing this, I realized that some tips may be helpful for other parents. I plan on writing those soon so stay tuned! </p>



<p>Even though Synagis is scary. It&#8217;s been a lifesaver for us. Our daughter hasn&#8217;t been sick but once (a small cold that didn&#8217;t need treated) in a year! Along with the Synagis, we practice good hand washing and isolation. We limit visitors to the extreme and made a commitment to keeping Bella as healthy as possible. I believe that these choices have contributed to her staying out of the hospital and thriving at home.</p>

<p>One of my favorite preemie social media pages is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/preemiehood/">Preemiehood</a>! I love their posts and keep up with them. When I was in the NICU, they inspired me so much and I related to them on a personal level. I shared one of their posts on my personal Facebook yesterday. It was called &#8220;What not to say to preemie parents: [the short list]&#8221; Some of the questions included &#8220;Why is their coloring so off?&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad I was able to carry my baby full term.&#8221; </p>



<p>The post was met with a lot of thumbs ups&#8230;and a few questions! Mostly, it seemed that others with non-preemies WANT to encourage preemie mommas, but don&#8217;t always know what to say. </p>



<p>OR they have a hunch of what NOT to say, but aren&#8217;t sure what TO say. So, here&#8217;s a quick post to help encourage others. </p>



<h2>10 Things To Say To Preemie Parents </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6459-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-79" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6459-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6459-300x225.jpg 300w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6459-768x576.jpg 768w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6459.jpg 1174w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>1. You are a wonderful parent to _________.</h2>



<p>Living in the NICU and giving birth to a preemie is very stressful. There are days when you are so exhausted you can&#8217;t even think straight. Whether you are confident in your parenting abilities or are struggling with mom guilt (yes, it&#8217;s real in the NICU as well), hearing you&#8217;re doing a good job is always appreciated. Telling a parent that they are a wonderful parent to their child will bring a smile to their face. If possible, use the child&#8217;s name. </p>



<h2>2. I haven&#8217;t been through a NICU stay, but it seems very challenging. </h2>



<p>Acknowledging a struggle can be so comforting! If you haven&#8217;t personally been through a NICU stay, try to not compare your situation, but, DO affirm the preemie parent by acknowledging that they are in a challenging situation. Also, you can say, &#8220;This SUCKS.&#8221; </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5192.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-80" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5192.jpg 660w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5192-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></figure>



<h2>3. I admire your strength/courage/positivity. </h2>



<p>Sometimes just hearing that you&#8217;re impacting others helps give you perspective while going through a NICU stay. Obviously while in the NICU I was dedicated to my daughter. I did everything for HER. But, in the process you can inspire others. Hearing that others admired certain attributes I displayed was such a special thing. I remember a friend told me she admired my strength and it made my day. Even when I wasn&#8217;t feeling &#8220;strong,&#8221; I knew I was showing enough strength for others to see! </p>



<h2>4. Do you mind sharing a little bit about (their child&#8217;s) conditions/struggles? I&#8217;d love to know more. </h2>



<p>NICU stays are complicated. It really is another universe. There&#8217;s NICU &#8220;lingo&#8221; and a bazillion health threats that are lurking around every corner. Most preemies will be on breathing support, are hooked up to monitors, have feeding tubes, and need medications. The babies in an isolette may look very different than the babies you&#8217;re used to seeing. That&#8217;s OK. A lot of parents don&#8217;t understand everything right away, but learn the terms and &#8220;ropes&#8221; after a few days or weeks. If you see something in a photo, or in person, and don&#8217;t understand it, ask! Always approach the subject with love and a genuine interest. I really enjoyed educating others about Isabella&#8217;s health. By explaining things, such as her NG tube, her need for caffeine, or even her A &amp; B spells, I helped myself to understand it better. I also appreciated others who were interested in her progress and health. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6970-1024x765.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-81" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6970-1024x765.jpg 1024w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6970-300x224.jpg 300w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6970-768x574.jpg 768w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6970.jpg 1178w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>5. You look great! </h2>



<p>There was a friend that happened to work at the visitors desk at our NICU. It was a crazy gift from God. The fact that I saw her almost everyday, and had gone to high school and college with her, couldn&#8217;t have been a coincidence. Anyway, she always complimented my makeup or outfits. This meant a lot to me. I didn&#8217;t always feel pulled together but used my free time to get makeup on and get dressed for the day. I didn&#8217;t always look done up, but when I made an effort, she noticed. It was a small thing, but it meant a lot. Obviously, only say &#8220;you look great,&#8221; if the parent really does look good! </p>



<h2>6. I&#8217;m thinking/praying of/for you and your family. <br></h2>



<p>Knowing someone is thinking and praying for you is very comforting. I remember after our first few days in the NICU a friend left a voice message of her praying for us. It was so powerful. I listened to it a few times and played it for Bella. Now, not everyone is comfortable enough to leave a recording of a prayer, haha, but just saying you&#8217;re thinking of someone can go a long way. Also, I had a friend that would just shoot me emojis. It was so simple, yet so impactful. I&#8217;d get a kissy face or a heart at just the right time during those long months from her. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h2>7. I&#8217;m sorry you&#8217;re going through this. </h2>



<p>There&#8217;s a lot of crappy stuff happening to preemie parents. They can&#8217;t take their baby home. They can&#8217;t hold them anytime they want. They can&#8217;t sleep in their own bed. There are a lot of hard things. Inconveniences just scratch the surface. Add the nonstop worry about their child surviving and then the financial strain and it&#8217;s one of the hardest things anyone has ever had to go through. One of the toughest things for me was seeing my baby struggle with breathing, eating, and getting her blood drawn. Most parents can&#8217;t say they&#8217;ve seen their baby struggle to breathe. So, it&#8217;s perfectly acceptable to say you&#8217;re sorry the family is going through what they&#8217;re going through. </p>



<h2>8. Can I help in any way?</h2>



<p>Only ask if you are prepared to help. If so, ask and offer to help. I was pretty open about our needs. We really appreciated meals. We really loved cards. A group from our church sent so many beautiful books that we read to Bella. If you aren&#8217;t sure, and really want to help, send cash, or a gift card. </p>

<h2>9. I love the way you ________________. (dress their child, decorate their room, post updates, make funny posts, etc.)</h2>



<p>A preemie parent has to get used to giving up control. In most cases they can&#8217;t even dress their child for quite some time since a lot of NICUs have a no clothing policy. (This is probably so that they can get to a baby quicker and keep an eye on their breathing/temperature regulation).  A nurse is doing the majority of the child&#8217;s care for the first few weeks and there just aren&#8217;t a ton of things to do for a parent but watch, pray, talk, read, pump (if they have milk) and wait. If a parent is like me, they work hard at decorating their NICU room, posting updates, and being creative. I spent a lot of time making signs for Isabella&#8217;s door and thinking of fun quotes to post on her letter board. When others acknowledged my hard work, it made me feel good. Later on, when Bella was able to wear clothes, others always complimented them. That made me feel good too. It was a nice way to compliment me on a &#8220;normal&#8221; aspect of motherhood.</p>

<h2>10. Can I give you a hug?</h2>



<p>Yep. A hug. Why ask? Well, unless you&#8217;re really close to the parent, they may not like hugs, or want to be touching people because of germs. A quick, simple, hug says you care. (PS- don&#8217;t offer a hug if you&#8217;ve been sick or around someone sick!) </p>



<p>There you have it. 10 simple things TO say to a preemie parent. I hope this gives you a good starting point. Luckily we had some amazing support while in the NICU. There were some super insensitive comments, but many more good ones than bad. </p>
