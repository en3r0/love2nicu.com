<p>One of my favorite preemie social media pages is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/preemiehood/">Preemiehood</a>! I love their posts and keep up with them. When I was in the NICU, they inspired me so much and I related to them on a personal level. I shared one of their posts on my personal Facebook yesterday. It was called &#8220;What not to say to preemie parents: [the short list]&#8221; Some of the questions included &#8220;Why is their coloring so off?&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad I was able to carry my baby full term.&#8221; </p>



<p>The post was met with a lot of thumbs ups&#8230;and a few questions! Mostly, it seemed that others with non-preemies WANT to encourage preemie mommas, but don&#8217;t always know what to say. </p>



<p>OR they have a hunch of what NOT to say, but aren&#8217;t sure what TO say. So, here&#8217;s a quick post to help encourage others. </p>



<h2>10 Things To Say To Preemie Parents </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6459-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-79" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6459-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6459-300x225.jpg 300w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6459-768x576.jpg 768w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6459.jpg 1174w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>1. You are a wonderful parent to _________.</h2>



<p>Living in the NICU and giving birth to a preemie is very stressful. There are days when you are so exhausted you can&#8217;t even think straight. Whether you are confident in your parenting abilities or are struggling with mom guilt (yes, it&#8217;s real in the NICU as well), hearing you&#8217;re doing a good job is always appreciated. Telling a parent that they are a wonderful parent to their child will bring a smile to their face. If possible, use the child&#8217;s name. </p>



<h2>2. I haven&#8217;t been through a NICU stay, but it seems very challenging. </h2>



<p>Acknowledging a struggle can be so comforting! If you haven&#8217;t personally been through a NICU stay, try to not compare your situation, but, DO affirm the preemie parent by acknowledging that they are in a challenging situation. Also, you can say, &#8220;This SUCKS.&#8221; </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5192.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-80" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5192.jpg 660w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5192-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></figure>



<h2>3. I admire your strength/courage/positivity. </h2>



<p>Sometimes just hearing that you&#8217;re impacting others helps give you perspective while going through a NICU stay. Obviously while in the NICU I was dedicated to my daughter. I did everything for HER. But, in the process you can inspire others. Hearing that others admired certain attributes I displayed was such a special thing. I remember a friend told me she admired my strength and it made my day. Even when I wasn&#8217;t feeling &#8220;strong,&#8221; I knew I was showing enough strength for others to see! </p>



<h2>4. Do you mind sharing a little bit about (their child&#8217;s) conditions/struggles? I&#8217;d love to know more. </h2>



<p>NICU stays are complicated. It really is another universe. There&#8217;s NICU &#8220;lingo&#8221; and a bazillion health threats that are lurking around every corner. Most preemies will be on breathing support, are hooked up to monitors, have feeding tubes, and need medications. The babies in an isolette may look very different than the babies you&#8217;re used to seeing. That&#8217;s OK. A lot of parents don&#8217;t understand everything right away, but learn the terms and &#8220;ropes&#8221; after a few days or weeks. If you see something in a photo, or in person, and don&#8217;t understand it, ask! Always approach the subject with love and a genuine interest. I really enjoyed educating others about Isabella&#8217;s health. By explaining things, such as her NG tube, her need for caffeine, or even her A &amp; B spells, I helped myself to understand it better. I also appreciated others who were interested in her progress and health. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6970-1024x765.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-81" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6970-1024x765.jpg 1024w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6970-300x224.jpg 300w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6970-768x574.jpg 768w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6970.jpg 1178w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>5. You look great! </h2>



<p>There was a friend that happened to work at the visitors desk at our NICU. It was a crazy gift from God. The fact that I saw her almost everyday, and had gone to high school and college with her, couldn&#8217;t have been a coincidence. Anyway, she always complimented my makeup or outfits. This meant a lot to me. I didn&#8217;t always feel pulled together but used my free time to get makeup on and get dressed for the day. I didn&#8217;t always look done up, but when I made an effort, she noticed. It was a small thing, but it meant a lot. Obviously, only say &#8220;you look great,&#8221; if the parent really does look good! </p>



<h2>6. I&#8217;m thinking/praying of/for you and your family. <br></h2>



<p>Knowing someone is thinking and praying for you is very comforting. I remember after our first few days in the NICU a friend left a voice message of her praying for us. It was so powerful. I listened to it a few times and played it for Bella. Now, not everyone is comfortable enough to leave a recording of a prayer, haha, but just saying you&#8217;re thinking of someone can go a long way. Also, I had a friend that would just shoot me emojis. It was so simple, yet so impactful. I&#8217;d get a kissy face or a heart at just the right time during those long months from her. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6630-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-82" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6630-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6630-300x225.jpg 300w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6630-768x576.jpg 768w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6630.jpg 1174w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>7. I&#8217;m sorry you&#8217;re going through this. </h2>



<p>There&#8217;s a lot of crappy stuff happening to preemie parents. They can&#8217;t take their baby home. They can&#8217;t hold them anytime they want. They can&#8217;t sleep in their own bed. There are a lot of hard things. Inconveniences just scratch the surface. Add the nonstop worry about their child surviving and then the financial strain and it&#8217;s one of the hardest things anyone has ever had to go through. One of the toughest things for me was seeing my baby struggle with breathing, eating, and getting her blood drawn. Most parents can&#8217;t say they&#8217;ve seen their baby struggle to breathe. So, it&#8217;s perfectly acceptable to say you&#8217;re sorry the family is going through what they&#8217;re going through. </p>



<h2>8. Can I help in any way?</h2>



<p>Only ask if you are prepared to help. If so, ask and offer to help. I was pretty open about our needs. We really appreciated meals. We really loved cards. A group from our church sent so many beautiful books that we read to Bella. If you aren&#8217;t sure, and really want to help, send cash, or a gift card. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5796-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-83" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5796-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5796-300x225.jpg 300w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5796-768x576.jpg 768w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5796.jpg 1174w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>9. I love the way you ________________. (dress their child, decorate their room, post updates, make funny posts, etc.)</h2>



<p>A preemie parent has to get used to giving up control. In most cases they can&#8217;t even dress their child for quite some time since a lot of NICUs have a no clothing policy. (This is probably so that they can get to a baby quicker and keep an eye on their breathing/temperature regulation).  A nurse is doing the majority of the child&#8217;s care for the first few weeks and there just aren&#8217;t a ton of things to do for a parent but watch, pray, talk, read, pump (if they have milk) and wait. If a parent is like me, they work hard at decorating their NICU room, posting updates, and being creative. I spent a lot of time making signs for Isabella&#8217;s door and thinking of fun quotes to post on her letter board. When others acknowledged my hard work, it made me feel good. Later on, when Bella was able to wear clothes, others always complimented them. That made me feel good too. It was a nice way to compliment me on a &#8220;normal&#8221; aspect of motherhood.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="blob:http://www.love2nicu.com/8c48200c-cbdc-4203-908c-75f3c6be926a" alt=""/></figure>



<h2>10. Can I give you a hug?</h2>



<p>Yep. A hug. Why ask? Well, unless you&#8217;re really close to the parent, they may not like hugs, or want to be touching people because of germs. A quick, simple, hug says you care. (PS- don&#8217;t offer a hug if you&#8217;ve been sick or around someone sick!) </p>



<p>There you have it. 10 simple things TO say to a preemie parent. I hope this gives you a good starting point. Luckily we had some amazing support while in the NICU. There were some super insensitive comments, but many more good ones than bad. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m staring at the amount billed to our insurance and I&#8217;m at a loss for words. </p>



<p>Speechless. For Once. </p>



<h4>Isabella&#8217;s care has cost over 1 MILLION DOLLARS&#8230;and counting. </h4>



<p>I knew from the beginning that having a baby 3 months early and having a high risk pregnancy would be pricey&#8230;but I didn&#8217;t expect to be able to say my daughter is indeed a million dollar baby. </p>



<p>So&#8230;how do you pay for all of this? Do we owe a million dollars? Are we eating rice and beans every meal and is our electric about to get shut off. Nope. But money IS tight. </p>



<p>For this post, I just wanted to explain WHY Isabella&#8217;s care within her first few months of life hit one million dollars and HOW we aren&#8217;t expected to pay all of it. I also wanted to do a breakdown of what resources I&#8217;ve found to help offset the cost. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5674.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-52" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5674.jpg 800w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5674-300x225.jpg 300w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5674-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption>Cuddling Our Sweet Girl</figcaption></figure>



<h1>Adding Up To One Million Dollars</h1>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3045-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-46" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3045-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3045-300x225.jpg 300w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3045-768x576.jpg 768w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3045.jpg 1156w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Isabella, shortly after birth, ready to be taken to the NICU </figcaption></figure>



<p>Our daughter, like many preemies, was born early. We joke that she&#8217;s &#8220;extra&#8221; because she never did things half way (and still doesn&#8217;t). Because of restricted growth, Bella was a micropreemie, weighting only 1lb 7ounces. She was 12 inches long. </p>



<p>She was extra tiny, extra early, extra fragile, and extra work! </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3047.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-47" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3047.jpg 650w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3047-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><figcaption>Meeting Isabella shortly after waking up from surgery. </figcaption></figure>



<p>From the beginning, she was transported with an incredibly specialized team who were ready to receive her. She was resuscitated in a &#8220;rainforest room&#8221; (an additional room ready to receive the tiniest and most fragile babies next to the operating room that is humid and warm like a rainforest) and then taken in a crazy &#8220;space-like&#8221; incubator to Akron Children&#8217;s Hospital, a few blocks away from where I delivered. </p>



<h3>The ride alone was over $6,000. </h3>



<p>From there, the charges add and add and add. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3081-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-51" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3081-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3081-300x225.jpg 300w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3081-768x576.jpg 768w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3081.jpg 1156w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>After birth. So thankful for life saving measures! </figcaption></figure>



<p>Everything from blood work to formula is calculated in her NICU stay. There are charges for everything and state-of-the-art care costs in one of the top NICUs in the world, is to be expected. </p>



<p>In total, Bella spent 78 days in the NICU. And then was readmitted until she hit 110 days. </p>



<h4>107 days were her total in an intensive care unit. </h4>



<p>When you think of a hospitalization, you begin to understand the cost. Isabella saw so many different specialists including Neonatologists, Dermatology, Surgeons, Nurse Practitioners, Nurses, Respiratory Therapists, Speech Therapy, Music Therapy, Physical Therapy, Dietitians, Pharmacists, and more!  </p>

<p>There is such a massive amount of specialization, expertise, technology, and all around devotion to keeping these tiny tiny babies alive and thriving! </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.managedcaremag.com/archives/2010/1/how-plans-can-improve-outcomes-and-cut-costs-preterm-infant-care">Managed Care Magazine</a>, the average daily cost in the NICU is $3,000. Of course, this isn&#8217;t entirely accurate because it&#8217;s not including all the &#8220;extras&#8221; and additional support preemies need. It does give you a good idea of how much a NICU stay costs though. </p>

<p>While in the NICU for 3 1/2 months, our income didn&#8217;t change too drastically. Dustin, my husband, worked from her room since he has a work-from-anywhere job and I took a leave of absence from my position at a non-profit so that I could focus on my pregnancy as soon as high risk issues arose. Of course, losing that income a month was a change, but not something that threw us off too much since it was a very little amount. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5415-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-55" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5415-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5415-300x225.jpg 300w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5415-768x576.jpg 768w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5415.jpg 1156w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Getting Her First &#8220;Bath&#8221;</figcaption></figure>



<p>There weren&#8217;t many bills, other than eating out/eating at the hospital (which was crazy expensive), gas, and other living expenses. This made it nice because although we were limited to one income, we were able to do things to distract us from the extreme stress and trauma of living in the NICU for 3 1/2 months. Also, our families visited often, buying us dinner, bringing us snacks, and we had so many amazing friends and family send gifts, money, gift cards, and more! As money got tighter and tighter (we used savings a bit) we actually were able to stay at the Ronald McDonald House! We made a plan to utilize ALL their free resources and this helped us save money and protect a little bit of our emergency fund (which wasn&#8217;t a lot). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6394.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-56" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6394.jpg 650w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6394-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><figcaption>Dustin enjoying snacks at Ronald McDonald House</figcaption></figure>



<p>By the time Bella was readmitted, we were feeling the financial pressure. We had learned the ropes but weren&#8217;t able to secure a room at Ronald McDonald because they were full. We bought groceries and made our own lunches to save money in her room. We also tried to eat cheap and ate our leftovers the next day after going out! </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5787.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-57" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5787.jpg 650w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_5787-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><figcaption>Enjoying a Coffee Break &amp; Checkers</figcaption></figure>



<p>We had a goal to pay off our credit card debt of about $1,000 give or take a hundred before Isabella was born. It had an interest rate of 20% and we hated that we&#8217;d not paid it off in full yet. As you can imagine, her coming 3 months early and living on one income (when we weren&#8217;t expecting to) adjusted our plans. We tried not to put NICU living expenses on the credit card, but I&#8217;m sure a few dinners got thrown on it. Because of others generosity, we got serious about paying off our one credit card when we got home from the NICU. Every time someone sent us money, or a gift card, or gift, we made sure to be frugal. Eventually we were able to pay off our debt and eliminate the interest&#8230;which we knew would be necessary once the big bills hit. We did this within 3 months of coming home.</p>

<h1>Who Pays? ONE MILLION? </h1>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Simon-Says-Smile-221-1024x819.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-48" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Simon-Says-Smile-221-1024x819.jpg 1024w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Simon-Says-Smile-221-300x240.jpg 300w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Simon-Says-Smile-221-768x614.jpg 768w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Simon-Says-Smile-221.jpg 1501w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Bella, 14 days old </figcaption></figure>



<p>My first question was always &#8220;how much will this cost?&#8221; to our social worker in the NICU. I was very aware of medical costs and was afraid of the impact this would have on our family financially. Even if we did everything &#8220;right&#8221; an event like this could certainly hurt a young family. </p>



<p>There wasn&#8217;t a lot I could do in the beginning for Isabella. I could do kangaroo care (skin to skin) which I did hours on end and I could pump breastmilk. Eventually my milk dried up and I turned my attention to learning all I could about services to help us continue to stay on our feet after all of this. For me, it was a small contribution, but I wanted to &#8220;pull my weight&#8221; and contribute, even if I only got us approved for $30 a month through SSI. For me, it was a worthy investment of my time in the NICU and allowed me to focus on other things when the beeps and monitors were too much. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6463-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-59" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6463-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6463-300x225.jpg 300w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6463-768x576.jpg 768w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6463.jpg 1156w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>So, back to WHO PAYS ONE MILLION? </h3>



<p>Well, actually, no one. </p>



<p>Insurances usually settle with the hospital for less. </p>



<h1>Our Ways Of Getting The Bills Covered</h1>



<h3><strong>Private Insurance, Cigna</strong> </h3>



<p>If you have insurance, they usually get hit the hardest. For us, before Bella was born we had private insurance, <a href="https://www.cigna.com/">Cigna</a>, through Dustin&#8217;s work. This immediately allowed us to add Bella to our plan after she was born without worrying about prematurity being considered a &#8220;pre-existing condition.&#8221; Our total max for her on this plan was $7K within a year. </p>



<p>We hit that within the first month. </p>



<p>After that, for the year, Cigna covers everything. This includes the rest of the hospital stay, prescriptions, surgery, durable medical equipment, appointments, therapy, and even formula! Thank the Lord. I thank God a lot for our insurance plan. </p>



<p>Of course, once the new year hit, we began working our way back up to that $7K. Which is incredibly difficult since we have a lot of medical expenses for Isabella. I plan on writing more about our relationship with Cigna and how things are progressing this year since we haven&#8217;t hit our deductible and are paying a lot of co-pays. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Simon-Says-Smile-204-1024x819.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-60" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Simon-Says-Smile-204-1024x819.jpg 1024w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Simon-Says-Smile-204-300x240.jpg 300w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Simon-Says-Smile-204-768x614.jpg 768w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Simon-Says-Smile-204.jpg 1501w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Preemies have very red skin! </figcaption></figure>



<h3><strong>SSI (While In The NICU) </strong></h3>



<p>While in the NICU, we applied for Social Security for Isabella. Honestly, it was a lot of work. We were led by our amazing NICU Social Worker. In the beginning, she explained our options and that we would only receive $30 (yes $30) a month while Bella was hospitalized. After that, we didn&#8217;t qualify based on our income. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Simon-Says-Smile-221-1-1024x819.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-61" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Simon-Says-Smile-221-1-1024x819.jpg 1024w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Simon-Says-Smile-221-1-300x240.jpg 300w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Simon-Says-Smile-221-1-768x614.jpg 768w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Simon-Says-Smile-221-1.jpg 1501w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Teeny Tiny Pampers! </figcaption></figure>



<p>For us, applying was kind of a no-brainer. Even though it was a lot of work, it was a good experience to see the inner workings of our SSI department AND $30 a month would help. Anything helped. I spent probably 3+ hours collecting and calling and applying in total. I believe it was worth it. In the end, we received 2, $30 deposits. I don&#8217;t remember if they gave us the $30 from the first month. So, 3 months = $90. $90 for 3 hours of applying? Worth it. In the end, we were shocked to learn that we were given a one time lump sum of $750. I still don&#8217;t understand why, but once she was discharged (the second time) we notified them and we were able to receive $750. We put this toward getting her a few things she needed (diapers, clothing, etc), creating a scrapbook for her, and buying some things for her nursery. </p>



<p><strong>Even though Bella has a feeding tube and is completely g-tube dependent and is considered a micropreemie, we do NOT receive any SSI for her now since we are over the income level.</strong> </p>



<p>This was surprising to me, because a child with special needs has special costs. I went ahead and applied anyway, just to do my due diligence. Nada. Zip. </p>



<h3><strong>BCMH, Diagnostic Program </strong></h3>



<p>BCMH, also known as the <a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/odh/know-our-programs/children-with-medical-handicaps/welcome-to">Bureau of Children with Medical Handicaps</a>, is a program through the Ohio Department of Health. Isabella qualified for their diagnostic program at birth because of her low birthweight or 660 grams. This program covers diagnostic expenses and other things like her ambulance ride. To be honest, I don&#8217;t really understand it. Some preemies qualify for the treatment program where it covers everything, while others, depending on their hospital and care team, only qualify for the diagnostic program. As it was explained to me, our admitting doctors/Neonatologists are only qualified for the diagnostic program so that&#8217;s why we are limited to that. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6542.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-62" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6542.jpg 867w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6542-150x150.jpg 150w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6542-300x300.jpg 300w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6542-768x768.jpg 768w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6542-640x640.jpg 640w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6542-90x90.jpg 90w" sizes="(max-width: 867px) 100vw, 867px" /><figcaption>Look at her growth! </figcaption></figure>



<p>At this point, I know our ambulance ride will be covered. It was explained that diagnostic related services will also be covered under BCMH. I still don&#8217;t know what this will include since we have YET to receive her bills in full. I will update this once I know! </p>



<h3><strong>Institutional Medicaid </strong></h3>



<p>One of the saving graces of OUR personal situation is<a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/index.html"> Institutionalized Medicaid</a>. I &lt;3 Institutionalized Medicaid. </p>



<p>Bella would NOT have qualified for medicaid coverage on her birthweight alone as I understand it. For us, the only reason we were able to receive coverage for one year was because she was hospitalized for over 30 days. </p>



<p>If a child is hospitalized for over 30 days within a year, they qualify for Institutionalized Medicaid. (In Ohio) </p>



<h4>This program only begins coverage after the first 30 days and ends at a year. The child will receive FULL coverage.</h4>



<p>We do not receive Medicaid for the first month since it didn&#8217;t kick in until day 30 in the NICU. *I have written a letter appealing this, but our income is over.  </p>



<p>In our case, Institutionalized Medicaid hasn&#8217;t helped a massive amount because we have Cigna, but it&#8217;s still been a big saving grace because of a few reasons. </p>



<h4>1.) WIC </h4>



<p>One, because we had Medicaid, Bella qualified for <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/women-infants-and-children-wic">WIC</a>. This alone would inspire me to apply for Medicaid. The WIC program helped us cover her very pricey formula before Cigna was approved to cover it. This was massive since her formula was $500 per month. I &lt;3 WIC. We also took advantage of the small amount of food they offer the mother the first month or two. This helped a little bit in saving money. </p>



<h4>2.) Other Expenses/Prescriptions </h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6550.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-63" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6550.jpg 650w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6550-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><figcaption>Daddy cuddling Bella</figcaption></figure>



<p>I don&#8217;t believe Institutionalized Medicaid was billed anything since they are considered secondary to Cigna. That being said, they help cover anything Cigna won&#8217;t. For the first year, Cigna has to cover everything if we hit our deductible. Now that it&#8217;s 2019 (sad face) we have to cover co-pays. BUT! Not yet! Not until April when our Medicaid coverage ends. So, Medicaid is picking up co-pays. </p>



<p>An example is this:</p>



<p>3 Prescriptions Per Month = $100 Co-pay</p>



<p>Specialist Visit = $60 Co-pay</p>



<p>Dr. Appointment/Well Visit = $30 Co-pay</p>



<p>Synagis Shot= $40 Co-pay</p>



<p>Right now, Medicaid covers our co-pays. Don&#8217;t ask me what we&#8217;re going to do when that coverage drops. We&#8217;ll have to figure out how to cover the additional $100-300 per month. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6568.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-64" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6568.jpg 650w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6568-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><figcaption>I love this owl sleeper </figcaption></figure>



<p>There&#8217;s a light of hope! I <del>bugged and bugged</del> and researched our options for coverage since money is so tight. It ends up we can ask to be considered for a waiver program. A waiver program is where you pay an amount for Medicaid coverage even if you&#8217;re over the income limit based on your child&#8217;s needs. I spoke with the national office and they said it&#8217;s up to the county office. Please pray we qualify so that we can continue to afford all her appointments and upcoming therapies. </p>



<h3>An Alternative Insurance, Christian Healthcare Ministries </h3>



<p>We have been members of <a href="https://www.chministries.org/">Christian Healthcare Ministries</a> for over 5 years. We knew we wanted a family and picked them as a medical bill sharing program because of their amazing maternity coverage. Little did we know we would need every bit of it. We have continued this coverage from when we were both self-employed and used it as a secondary option of coverage in addition to Cigna. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6594-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-65" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6594-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6594-300x225.jpg 300w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6594-768x576.jpg 768w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6594.jpg 1156w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Getting bigger and bigger </figcaption></figure>



<p>The way it works is that for women in their &#8220;Gold Program,&#8221; they receive their pregnancies covered, up to about $100K. Once you receive your bills, you submit them for sharing. The organization, which is exempt from Obamacare and recognized as an alternative insurance by the government, shares the costs using members monthly fees. </p>



<p>They also work with hospitals to reduce debt amounts, just like a traditional insurance company. </p>



<p>Newborns are covered under their moms for the first 3 months. This is amazing since Bella&#8217;s expenses are eligible for sharing for the first month. (This was when Medicaid didn&#8217;t cover because of our income). For us, this is an incredibly amazing blessing. We thank God we continued to be a part of this program. We didn&#8217;t foresee this happening and it&#8217;s so amazing to know the $7K we owe for Isabella (and $7K for me) has the opportunity to be potentially covered in full. </p>



<p>The only draw back is that I must remain a member for bills to be eligible for sharing. </p>



<h4>AND they would like bills submitted to be considered. We have yet to receive many bills. </h4>



<p>So I continue to pay as a member ($150 a month) until we can officially submit the bills (after insurance and other program adjustments) for being covered. After that, the process can take up to 6 months to a year. </p>



<p>In the past I&#8217;ve utilized Christian Healthcare Ministries for my miscarriage costs ($1,500) and a trip to the ER ($3,000). It&#8217;s an amazing organization. </p>

<p>And, it was Bella&#8217;s first NICU room number. </p>



<p>711</p>

<p>I seriously thought Dustin paid someone to put her in that room. Crazy impossible that they&#8217;d chose to put a critical micropreemie intubated in a room based on a husbands number wishes when he didn&#8217;t even know what floor she&#8217;d be on. Haha </p>



<h4>I felt like it was God&#8217;s way of saying &#8220;I got this.&#8221; and &#8220;I got you.&#8221; </h4>



<p>But, I don&#8217;t love owing $7K. </p>



<h4>And it&#8217;s not just $7K. It&#8217;s double. </h4>



<p>It&#8217;s double because of MY/her care before her birth as well. Most mommas of preemies are hospitalized before their delivery. In my case, I was hospitalized for about 10 days in a high risk unit/post-ward and had an emergency c-section with general anesthesia that really ups the ante. </p>



<h5>My max out of pocket was also $7K, which totals our family&#8217;s max out of pocket for one year to $14K. </h5>



<h1>So&#8230;How Do You Pay Off The $14K?</h1>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6623.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-67" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6623.jpg 650w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6623-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><figcaption>First meeting Bella in the NICU </figcaption></figure>



<p>I honestly don&#8217;t know. I guess the answer here would be slowly. IF your hospital/place of billing will work with you. </p>



<h3>Ask Ask Ask </h3>



<p>For us, we have only received ONE LARGE BILL that we are currently responsible for. (We have yet to receive any of the others). </p>



<p>And that was for my care from <a href="https://www.smfm.org/members/what-is-a-mfm">Maternal Fetal Medicine</a> while at the delivering hospital. The amount after insurance is about $3K. They wanted around $150-200 a month toward it. We could possibly afford that as a minimum whole, but not if we have 3-4 more bills with that minimum. (Who could afford an additional $600 a month PLUS ongoing new medical expenses?) </p>



<p>I called our case manager at the hospital, asking how do we afford all of this? She wasn&#8217;t much help. She said SHE had to let bills go to collections after a few brain surgeries and SHE was working as a nurse. She explained that the best way to handle it was to call and talk and talk and ask. So that&#8217;s what we did.</p>



<h3><strong>Collections&#8230;But Not Really </strong></h3>



<p>We didn&#8217;t qualify based on our income for their discounted program, so we opted for a program that is for extenuating circumstances. (We wrote a letter explaining our situation and our other bills and why I can&#8217;t work and have to care for Bella).</p>



<p>The solution: they outsource billing to a collections agency (it doesn&#8217;t &#8220;go to collections&#8221;) and we pay on it per month; a smaller, more affordable amount. If we miss a month they can &#8220;send it to collections&#8221; and it shows up unpaid. We have to pay them every month without a reminder. It&#8217;s basically a third party debt collector. For us, it was the only option. Our amount we pay is $75 a month on one bill. The best part is it has no interest. So that helps a lot. </p>

<h1>But What About The Other Bills? </h1>



<h4>We. Haven&#8217;t. Gotten. Them. YET. </h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6912.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-70" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6912.jpg 650w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_6912-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><figcaption>Looking cute with pink roses </figcaption></figure>



<p>We can see how much we owe from our Cigna patient portal. We know how much has been billed to them. BUT we haven&#8217;t received the rest of the bills. </p>



<p>At one point we received a bill from my delivering hospital. It was for about $3k after insurance. We called and they said to disregard it because they were still settling with our insurance and had missed a charge or two when billing.</p>



<p>We call the Children&#8217;s Hospital and they said that although they&#8217;ve received a rather large amount from our insurance&#8230;it isn&#8217;t enough and they&#8217;re appealing them. I ask when we should expect it to be taken care of/when we should receive our bill, and she says she doesn&#8217;t know. </p>



<p>I ask how much (I know it must be about $7K from the patient portal) but she can&#8217;t tell me because they haven&#8217;t ran it through the other programs. </p>



<p>Bella will be one years old on March 1st. We spent 3 1/2 months in the NICU and have been out for 7 1/2. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_7164.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-71" srcset="https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_7164.jpg 650w, https://love2nicu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_7164-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><figcaption>Moved to an open crib</figcaption></figure>



<p>For now, everyone says to be thankful we aren&#8217;t responsible for these bills yet since they&#8217;re still being adjusted with insurance and other billing. </p>



<h4>BUT it&#8217;s stressful having it hanging over your head. It&#8217;s stressful not really knowing the amount, although we have an idea it&#8217;s $14K. </h4>



<p>But, we are so thankful we are carrying Christian Healthcare Ministries and pray that they can share the cost of the $14K (or unknown amount we owe) when the time comes. </p>
